    vars: user_host_vars
    version_added: "2.10"
    short_description: In charge of loading user_vars and host_vars vars for 'localhost'
    requirements:
        - whitelist in configuration
    description:
        - Loads all vars for the corresponding user from the user_vars/ directory and hostname from host_vars/ directory.
        - Files are restricted by extension to one of .yaml, .json, .yml or no extension.
        - Hidden (starting with '.') and backup (ending with '~') files and directories are ignored.
        - Only applies to usernames and hostnames that are existing paths.
    notes:
        - This plugin will only provide the extra variables for the 'localhost' host entity.
        - This plugin will append hostname vars to user vars. We might make this configurable.
